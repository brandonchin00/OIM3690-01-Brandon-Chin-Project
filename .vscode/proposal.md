 Project Proposal: WebTech OIM 3690 0-1

 1) What is your Website about?
    My website will be a portfolio website containing all my internship experience, projects, contact me form, and resume. 

 2) What is the objective of your website?
    This is to demostrate to employers my ability in HTML/CSS Javascript and Python (hopefully). I want to showcase my work in a more interactive way so that I can stand out to employers. 

 3) Target Audience?
    Recruiters and Hiring Managers

 4) What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?
    Nav Bar: Home, Experience, Resume, Contact Me, Case Study

    I will use a smooth scroll method to each page. It will start from the top and create a storytelling stlye. As the user scrolls, it slowly goes into each page. The Nav Bar will hyperlink to those sections, if recruiters would like to search. 

    I will have my internship experiences and objectives I have done. 

    I will include my Resume PDF and target _blank. 

    I will have a contact form for employers to fill out and it will email to my set email address

    I will also include my case study on Amazon. I might expand this for other projects I've done for class.
