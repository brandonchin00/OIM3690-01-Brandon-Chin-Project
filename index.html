        <h2>1) What is your Website about?</h2>
        <p>My website will be a portfolio website containing all my internship experience, projects, contact me form, and resume. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>2) What is the objective of your website?</h2>
        <p>This is to demostrate to employers my ability in HTML/CSS Javascript and Python (hopefully). I want to showcase my work in a more interactive way so that I can stand out to employers.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3) Target Audience?</h2>
        <p>Recruiters and Hiring Managers</p>
        <br>
        <h2>4) What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Nav Bar: Home, Experience, Resume, Contact Me, Case Study</li>
            <li>I will use a smooth scroll method to each page. It will start from the top and create a storytelling stlye. As the user scrolls, it slowly goes into each page. The Nav Bar will hyperlink to those sections, if recruiters would like to search.</li>
            <li>I will have my internship experiences and objectives I have done.</li>
            <li>I will include my Resume PDF and target _blank.</li>
            <li>I will have a contact form for employers to fill out and it will email to my set email address</li>
            <li>I will also include my case study on Amazon. I might expand this for other projects I've done for class. </li>
        </ul>
